Conclusion: Conclusion: We will not go with 3 and 4 clusters because one cluster is capturing more than 40% data which will generalize the clusters.																			
		We will go with 6 clusters because the one uncommon cluster in 6 clusters is capturing relevant data and is new information.											
		Therefore, we will go with 6 clusters as per the qualitative analysis for clustering in which all clusters have specefic properties.											


Kindly check the Profiling_output excel file for qualitative analysis.
